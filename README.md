# Entertainment Watchlist
Entertainment Watchlist allows you to look up movies and series, visit IMDb to learn more about them, and add them to your watchlist to track the list you plan to watch. Entertainment Watchlist uses local storage, in which, unfortunately, at this time your list won't carry over to other devices, but I will most likely add this in the future.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Uses JavaScript and API to fetch the data the user put in the input and returns a list of movies and series. Added a function to the on buttons to add or remove movies and series from your watchlist. Whenever you search for a movie and series, you see the ones that you add to the list listed as remove from the watchlist in order to avoid duplicates. The list you create is stored in local storage, which saves the list you created unless you remove it.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to store them in the local storage and convert the array of movies and series to a string to store them, and convert back to an array when needed.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
